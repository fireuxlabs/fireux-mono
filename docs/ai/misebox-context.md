# Misebox GPT Context

This is the single context entrypoint for an external GPT focused on Misebox
inside `fireuxlabs/fireux-mono`.

## Refresh instructions

Before each task:

1. Use the current default branch of `fireuxlabs/fireux-mono`, not a cached or
   previously uploaded snapshot.
2. Read `docs/ai/gpt-context.md` and the root `AGENTS.md` completely.
3. Inspect the current Misebox ecosystem package at
   `packages/ecosystem/fireux-misebox` and the relevant app under
   `projects/misebox/*`.
4. Follow the Concept Cascade in `AGENTS.md`. For kitchen, menu, ordering,
   console, Firestore, public surfaces, layouts, or app configuration, read the
   corresponding smallest `docs/concepts/*.md` map before inspecting code.
5. Find the nearest working sibling in the same FireUX family before proposing
   a Misebox-specific implementation.

## Misebox boundaries

- Shared Misebox identity, configuration, layouts, and ecosystem behavior
  belong in `packages/ecosystem/fireux-misebox`.
- Reusable kitchen, menu, ordering, supplier, product, and other domain truth
  belongs in the owning extension package under `packages/extensions/*`.
- `defineFireuxConfig` loads `fireux-misebox` automatically from
  `ecosystem: 'misebox'`. Misebox apps declare extension modules as explicit
  capabilities; the ecosystem package is not an umbrella dependency bundle.
- The ecosystem package must not own tenant-id branches, Kitchen/Menu source
  defaults, or a competing public Menu renderer. Public Menu routes, layout,
  resolution, and ordering projections belong to `fireux-kitchens`.
- `projects/misebox/*` apps may compose and configure package-owned behavior;
  they should not recreate shared domain truth locally.
- Tenant branding, content, routes, and genuine app-specific presentation may
  remain in the relevant project app.

Current code, executable guards, and tests are implementation truth. Concept
maps provide navigation and working context. Deleted docs, previous chat
context, cached repository snapshots, and remembered implementations are not
authority. If current files cannot be read, say the Misebox context could not
be refreshed.

## Living context

Treat this file as the living entrypoint for the dedicated Misebox chat.

- Re-check it whenever Misebox package ownership, app boundaries, domain
  families, or required concept maps change.
- Update this file in the same repository change when a stable Misebox change
  makes its scope, boundaries, or refresh instructions incomplete or wrong.
- Update `docs/ai/gpt-context.md` instead when the change applies to all FireUX
  chats; update both only when both layers genuinely change.
- Keep temporary task status, chat summaries, migration progress, and product
  ideas out of this file. It should contain durable routing and authority.
- If an update is needed but the current task cannot edit the repository, state
  exactly what has become stale and which current source proves it.

When discussing canon, spine, alignment, family, or drift, state what must
match, what may differ, the nearest working sibling, and the affected files.
